PhonePe Transaction & Demographic Data Analysis
Overview

This project analyzes PhonePe transaction data alongside demographic information across Indian states and districts. It aims to uncover insights into transaction trends, device usage, user behavior, and demographic correlations, while ensuring data consistency and quality. The project leverages Python for data loading, exploration, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

Datasets

The analysis uses multiple datasets covering state and district levels:

State_Txn and Users: State-level transaction and user data.

State_TxnSplit: Breakdown of transaction types per state.

State_DeviceData: Device brands used by registered users per state.

District_Txn and Users: District-level transaction and user data.

District Demographics: Population, area, and density details per district.

Key Tasks

Data Loading & Understanding: Load datasets, display structure, and check missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze transaction trends, top states, common transaction types, device usage, and top districts by population.

Data Quality Checks: Ensure consistency between state and district-level data.

Advanced Analysis: Calculate user-to-population ratios, correlate population density with transaction volumes, and device brand usage ratios.

Visualization: Plot trends in transactions and amounts over time, and generate bar and column charts for key insights.
